A Toy Messenger w Java

Steps to run:
1. compile both .java files
2. start the server (from a terminal) with: _$ java MessagingServer_
3. start the client from a terminal with: _$ java MessagingClient localhost_
4. type input into the client and see the input echoed back from the server

This can serve as a starting point for a more sophisticated chat bot or messaging service.
