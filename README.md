A Toy Messenger w Java

If you are interested in low-level network programming, and/or you don't want to
jump to a high-level interface (e.g. Discord chatbot), then this is a good
option. 

Steps to run:
1. compile both .java files
2. start the server (from a terminal) with: _$ java MessagingServer_
3. start the client from a terminal with: _$ java MessagingClient localhost_
4. type input into the client and see the input echoed back from the server
